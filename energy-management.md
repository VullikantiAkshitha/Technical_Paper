# Energy Management: Technical Paper

## 1. Manage Energy, Not Time

### Emotional Quadrants
The four emotional quadrants are:

- **Excitement**  
- **Stress**  
- **Depression**  
- **Calm**  

The goal is to remain in **Excitement, Stress, and Calm** quadrants to live a happy, calm, and engaging life. Stress is inevitable, but learning to handle it can improve skill and reduce anxiety.

**Reflection Questions:**

2. **Stress Quadrant Triggers**  
   *Situations when I feel stressed:*
   - Example: Learning new skills, tight deadlines, intense workouts.

3. **Excitement Quadrant Awareness**
